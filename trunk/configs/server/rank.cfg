// Determines if the player can select all the weapons/perks/etc. available in the game
// or just the ones that he has unlocked in-game. Disable for matches (e.g. wars).
// Note: Even if enabled, players can manually unlock weapons anytime (if they want, or progress
// normally unlocking them through the ranking system).
// 0 = Disabled, 1 = Enabled (default)
// set scr_ranked_classes_enable "1"

// If enabled, player doesn't earn points (XP) during matches, thus can't progress his
// rank and unlock new stuff.
// 0 = Disabled (default), 1 = Enabled
// set scr_forceunrankedmatch "0"


// This variable controls if virtual ranks should be enable or not (when scr_forceunrankedmatch is enabled).
// Virtual ranks are ranks that are assigned to players when they connect to the server based on their name. 
// So, for example, if a virtual rank "Sgt." is defined with a ranking level of 12 then a player connecting to
// the server with the string "Sgt." within his/her name will be assigned a ranking level of 12. 
// 0 = Disabled (default), 1 = Enabled (use ranks in names), 2 = Enabled (rank is based on score)
// set scr_enable_virtual_ranks "0"

// Abbreviation contained in the player's name and the rank to be assigned based on it
// set scr_virtual_ranks "Pfc.=3;LCpl.=6;Cpl.=9;Sgt.=12;SSgt.=15;GySgt.=18;MSgt.=21;MGySgt.=24;2ndLt.=27;1stLt.=30;Capt.=33;Maj.=36;LtCol.=39;Col.=42;BGen.=45;MajGen.=48;LtGen.=51;Gen.=54;CDR.=55"

// Total number of points for each virtual rank level. The player will advance its virtual rank level during the game based on points.
// Allowed values: 1-10000 (default is 50)
